# Luke Courtney's Portfolio (Vite + React + TypeScript)

This is my portfolio website, a replica of my [old portfolio](https://github.com/lfcourtney/luke-courtneys-portfolio) website moved over to a Single Page Application. This Single Page Application is developed using React + TypeScript + Vite.

### Initialize project locally

1. `npm install`
1. `npm run dev` and play with the local dev environment.
1. `npm run build`.

# Update

1. Run `npm update` every so often; this ensures that packages are kept up to date.
